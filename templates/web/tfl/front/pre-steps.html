        All issues reported on Streetcare continue to be monitored by our teams at
        Transport for London. We are not able to carry out all of our normal
        maintenance works at the moment but we are working hard to deal with all
        safety critical issues.

    If you are concerned about pavement overcrowding during social distancing
    on the Transport for London Road Network, you can now report that to us
    here.
